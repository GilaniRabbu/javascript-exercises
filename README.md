# What is JavaScript?

- Javascript is high level programming languages, single threaded and non blocking.
- JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language.
- It is an object-oriented language that provides features such as variables, arrays, loops, functions, and objects.
- JavaScript can be used to add interactivity to websites, validate forms, and perform asynchronous tasks through its support for event handling.
- The code is executed by the browser and can interact with HTML and CSS to dynamically update the content and style of web pages.
- JavaScript is often used in combination with other technologies such as React, Angular, and Vue to build complex web applications.

## Displaying Data in JavaScript
- Writing into an HTML element, using `innerHTML`.
- Writing into the HTML output using `document.write()`.
- Writing into an alert box, using `window.alert()`.

- The only exception is that you can call the `window.print()` method in the browser to print the content of the current window.
